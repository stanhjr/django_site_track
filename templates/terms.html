1.3. Exclusivity/Commitment to Sell.The Marketplace shall be the exclusive listing site for Equipment and you shall not offer for sale or sell the Equipment in any other manner until the earlier of (a) the date such Equipment is sold via the Auction or (b) the date you withdraw the Equipment from the Auction as permitted herein. By entering into this Agreement for use of the Marketplace, you hereby extend an irrevocable offer to sell the Equipment, as applicable, (a) to a Buyer who is the highest bidder and who meets or exceeds the opening bid, the Reserve Price, or Asking Price, as applicable (b) to a Buyer who commits to purchase Equipment at the Buy Now Price; or (c) to a Buyer who commits to purchase Equipment at the Negotiated Price.

You may lower the Asking Price during a listing period, but you may not add an Asking Price after the opening time. If you have selected to list the Equipment by Reserve, you will have the option of setting a reserve price, not to exceed 120% of estimated market value as determined by Buymyfleet ("Reserve Price"). Buymyfleet will determine the period of time that the Reserve listing is published to the website and is available for Buyers to submit bids (the "Reserve Period"). If, at the end of the Reserve Period, the Reserve Price has been met, the highest bid received from a Buyer will be automatically accepted. If the Reserve Price is not met during the Reserve Period, Buymyfleet may elect to re-list the Equipment.

Upon acceptance of the Counter Offer by the Buyer, the listing is closed and you are legally bound to complete the transaction.
1.6. Conclusion of Purchase; Bill of Sale. After the winning bid for a piece of Equipment has been established, the Buyer has committed to purchase the Equipment at the Buy Now Price or the Asking Price, the bid or purchase commitment of Buyer will be automatically accepted by you and a binding obligation to purchase and sell between you and Buyer is automatically created ("Binding Obligation").

If the Equipment was not inspected, you must supply updated Listing Details.
